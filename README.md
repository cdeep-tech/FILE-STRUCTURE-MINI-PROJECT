What is unique in the code?

•	Present time of the system will be displayed !!

This code will  explain the details of the prison management system.

Once the username and password are entered 8 features will be provided

1.	New prisoner entry:  where the user can enter the details of the prisoners for example name, age, height, eye color, punishment duration, etc.

2.	Prisoner details: where you can check all the details of the prisoners

3.	Attendance prisoner: where you can check the attendance  record of the prisoners and here you can also decrease the punishment span of the prisoners

4.	Release prisoner: where you can release the prisoner only if he/she completes the punishment duration 

5.	Search prisoner: where you can search any prisoner by their cell number

6.	Prison File: where you can download the details of the prisoners in three different file formats 1) text file 2)HTML file 3)word file

7.	Logout: where you will log out of the system and will be directed back to the login page

The code will be more efficient at use.
